Speaker,Text
ADEIMANTUS,"Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged?"
SOCRATES,"Why, what else is there?  I answered."
ADEIMANTUS,"The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied."
SOCRATES,"Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother'--if he fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me the power of helping justice."
ADEIMANTUS,"Nonsense, he replied.  But let me add something more:  There is another side to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I believe to be his meaning.  Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages, and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others; for they throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the just-- To hear acorns at their summit, and bees I the middle; And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces. and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them.  And Homer has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is-- As the fame of some blameless king who, like a god, Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit, And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish. Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue.  Some extend their rewards yet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation.  This is the style in which they praise justice.  But about the wicked there is another strain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water in a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their invention supply.  Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other. Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but is found in prose writers.  The universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and toilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment, and are only censured by law and opinion.  They say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential, while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor, even though acknowledging them to be better than the others.  But most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men, and good and happiness to the wicked.  And mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's own or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, at a small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they say, to execute their will.  And the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;-- Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and her dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil, and a tedious and uphill road:  then citing Homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men; for he also says: The gods, too, may he turned from their purpose; and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed. And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were children of the Moon and the Muses--that is what they say--according to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals, but whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at the service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call mysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us. He proceeded:  And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?  Probably the youth will say to himself in the words of Pindar-- Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days? For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable.  But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of justice, a heavenly life is promised to me.  Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote myself.  I will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus, greatest of sages, recommends.  But I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing great is easy.  Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be happy, to be the path along which we should proceed.  With a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs.  And there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies; and so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful gains and not be punished.  Still I hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived, neither can they be compelled.  But what if there are no gods? or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in either case should we mind about concealment?  And even if there are gods, and they do care about us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let us be consistent then, and believe both or neither.  If the poets speak truly, why then we had better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; for if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we shall lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep the gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the gods will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished.  'But there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds.' Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries and atoning deities, and these have great power.  That is what mighty cities declare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets and prophets, bear a like testimony. On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us.  Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised?  And even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to forgive them, because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has attained knowledge of the truth--but no other man.  He only blames injustice who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the power of being unjust.  And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be. The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice--beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and ending with the men of our own time--no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits which flow from them.  No one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things of a man's soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong, but every one would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils.  I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating, and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly, as I conceive, perverting their true nature.  But I speak in this vehement manner, as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from you the opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him.  And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations; for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false, we shall say that you do not praise justice, but the appearance of it; we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's good and the interest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man's own profit and interest, though injurious to the weaker.  Now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results, but in a far greater degree for their own sakes--like sight or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good--I would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, I am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your own lips, I expect something better.  And therefore, I say, not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and men."
SOCRATES,"Sons of an illustrious father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the admirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of Megara:-- 'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious hero.' The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice, and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments.  And I do believe that you are not convinced--this I infer from your general character, for had I judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you.  But now, the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say.  For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I feel that I am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made to Thrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the superiority which justice has over injustice.  And yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and speech remain to me; I am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence.  And therefore I had best give such help as I can. Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop, but to proceed in the investigation.  They wanted to arrive at the truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly, about their relative advantages.  I told them, what I really thought, that the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very good eyes.  Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger--if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first, and then proceed to the lesser--this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune."
ADEIMANTUS,"Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry?"
SOCRATES,"I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State."
ADEIMANTUS,"True, he replied."
SOCRATES,And is not a State larger than an individual?
ADEIMANTUS,It is.
SOCRATES,"Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible.  I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them."
ADEIMANTUS,"That, he said, is an excellent proposal."
SOCRATES,"And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the justice and injustice of the State in process of creation also."
ADEIMANTUS,I dare say.
SOCRATES,When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered.
ADEIMANTUS,"Yes, far more easily."
SOCRATES,"But ought we to attempt to construct one?  I said; for to do so, as I am inclined to think, will be a very serious task.  Reflect therefore."
ADEIMANTUS,"I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should proceed."
SOCRATES,"A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind; no one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants.  Can any other origin of a State be imagined?"
ADEIMANTUS,There can I be no other.
SOCRATES,"Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply them, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a State."
ADEIMANTUS,"True, he said."
SOCRATES,"And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives, under the idea that the exchange will be for their good."
ADEIMANTUS,Very true.
SOCRATES,"Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention."
ADEIMANTUS,"Of course, he replied."
SOCRATES,"Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the condition of life and existence."
ADEIMANTUS,Certainly.
SOCRATES,"The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like."
ADEIMANTUS,True.
SOCRATES,"And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one else a weaver--shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants?"
ADEIMANTUS,Quite right.
SOCRATES,The barest notion of a State must include four or five men.
ADEIMANTUS,Clearly.
SOCRATES,"And how will they proceed?  Will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three-fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?"
ADEIMANTUS,He should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything.
SOCRATES,"Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear you say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations."
ADEIMANTUS,Very true.
SOCRATES,"And will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations, or when he has only one?"
ADEIMANTUS,When he has only one.
SOCRATES,"Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?"
ADEIMANTUS,No doubt.
SOCRATES,"For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the business his first object."
ADEIMANTUS,He must.
SOCRATES,"And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things."
ADEIMANTUS,Undoubtedly..
SOCRATES,"Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture, if they are to be good for anything.  Neither will the builder make his tools--and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker."
ADEIMANTUS,True.
SOCRATES,"Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?"
ADEIMANTUS,True.
SOCRATES,"Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides,--still our State will not be very large."
ADEIMANTUS,That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains all these.
SOCRATES,"Then, again, there is the situation of the city--to find a place where nothing need be imported is well-nigh impossible."
ADEIMANTUS,Impossible.
SOCRATES,Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city?
ADEIMANTUS,There must.
SOCRATES,"But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed."
ADEIMANTUS,That is certain.
SOCRATES,"And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied."
ADEIMANTUS,Very true.
SOCRATES,Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?
ADEIMANTUS,They will.
SOCRATES,"Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?"
ADEIMANTUS,Yes.
SOCRATES,Then we shall want merchants?
ADEIMANTUS,We shall.
SOCRATES,"And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will also be needed, and in considerable numbers?"
ADEIMANTUS,"Yes, in considerable numbers."
SOCRATES,"Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions? To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a State."
ADEIMANTUS,Clearly they will buy and sell.
SOCRATES,"Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of exchange."
ADEIMANTUS,Certainly.
SOCRATES,"Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him,--is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?"
ADEIMANTUS,"Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake the office of salesmen.  In well-ordered States they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for any other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy."
SOCRATES,"This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State.  Is not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants?"
ADEIMANTUS,"Yes, he said."
SOCRATES,"And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour."
ADEIMANTUS,True.
SOCRATES,Then hirelings will help to make up our population?
ADEIMANTUS,Yes.
SOCRATES,"And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?"
ADEIMANTUS,I think so.
SOCRATES,"Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of the State did they spring up?"
ADEIMANTUS,Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another.  cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else.
SOCRATES,"I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had better think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry. Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life, now that we have thus established them.  Will they not produce corn, and wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves?  And when they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod.  They will feed on barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making noble cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle.  And they and their children will feast, drinking of the wine which they have made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning the praises of the gods, in happy converse with one another.  And they will take care that their families do not exceed their means; having an eye to poverty or war."
